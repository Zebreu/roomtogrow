GMTK 2024 game jam - Built To Scale entry 

https://zebreu.itch.io/built-to-scale-a-building-2024-game-jam-entry

Done in about 13 or so hours while tinkering with retro fantasy console (https://github.com/kitao/pyxel). You can simply play via the html file but the browser will mess up the music a bit.

Press m to mute the music, R to reset the game.
